# LeelaZeroTweeter

Leela Zero is a large distributed machine learning project, attempting to recreate [DeepMind's success](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) and produce the strongest open source Go playing engine.

New models are trained from the user generated data every few hours and tested against the previous strongest model. If the model succeeds, it is automatically sent out to all the contributors and used to generate the next batch of games for training. 

This twitter bot checks the project website ([zero.sjeng.org](http://zero.sjeng.org/)) and tweets updates on promising and newly promoted networks.

This bot is currently deployed on AWS, and the twitter account can be found at: [twitter.com/razzamataz99](https://twitter.com/razzamataz99)
